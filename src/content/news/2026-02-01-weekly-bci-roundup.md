This is a placeholder *draft* post so the site has a working end-to-end pipeline.

## Format I suggest (medium)

- **1–2 sentence headline**: what happened + why you care.
- **3–6 bullets** with links and your commentary.
- **One deeper paragraph** on the most important item.
- **What I’m watching next week** (2–3 bullets).
