The University of Florida (UF) has an active biomedical engineering department and a broader ecosystem that includes neural engineering research and training.

- UF Biomedical Engineering home: <https://bme.ufl.edu/>

An example of the department running structured neural engineering training:
- Neural Engineering Day / course activity (UF BME): <https://bme.ufl.edu/2019/04/30/neural-engineering-day-poster-winners-announced-2/>

## TODO (citation upgrades)

- Identify and add specific UF labs relevant to invasive BCI (signals/decoding, neural interfaces, neuromodulation).
- Add 2–4 flagship publications.
