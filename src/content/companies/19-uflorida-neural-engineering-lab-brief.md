The **University of Florida (UF)** has an ecosystem-level footprint in BCI/neurotechnology spanning:
1) **neural decoding** (including MEG-based speech/phoneme decoding work),
2) **clinical neurotech + neuromodulation / brain mapping**, and
3) **interface biology / biomaterials**.

## Clean claims you can make (with sources)
1) UF Neurology publicly describes BCI work aimed at synthesizing speech from neural activity using MEG and deep learning. <https://neurology.ufl.edu/ibrain-lab/research-2/bci/>
2) UF BME explicitly organizes **Neural Engineering** as a faculty/research area. <https://bme.ufl.edu/people/faculty/cat/primary-faculty/neural-engineering/>
