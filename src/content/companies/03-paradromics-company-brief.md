Paradromics is building an **implantable, high data‑rate brain–computer interface (BCI)** designed to record activity at (or near) the **single‑neuron** level and translate it into **speech/text and computer control**. Their flagship clinical product is the **Connexus® BCI**, aimed first at restoring communication for people with severe motor impairment (e.g., ALS, spinal cord injury, stroke).

This brief focuses on the **technology**, **clinical path**, and **company facts** we can support with public sources.

## The technology (Connexus BCI)

Paradromics describes Connexus as a **fully implantable system** intended for long‑term use, using materials common in medical implants (e.g., titanium alloy housing, platinum‑iridium electrodes) and miniaturized microelectrodes.

- Connexus product page (materials, form factor, high‑level system description):
  - <https://www.paradromics.com/product>

### 1) Implant architecture (as publicly described)
Paradromics describes three main implanted components:

- **Cortical module** (implanted under the skin; microelectrodes extend just below the brain surface)
- **Internal transceiver** (implanted in the chest)
- **Extension lead** (connects cortical module to chest transceiver)

They describe the chest transceiver as handling **wireless optical data transmission** to an external transceiver worn by the user, and **inductive power transfer** (wireless charging style) to power the implant.

- Company description of “How it works” steps: <https://www.paradromics.com/product>

### 2) Channel counts + scaling strategy
Paradromics claims:
- **421 microelectrodes** per cortical module
- the ability to link **up to 4 implants** for **1600+ intracortical channels**

- Company platform description: <https://www.paradromics.com/>
- Product page details: <https://www.paradromics.com/product>

### 3) Decoding stack (software)
Paradromics describes sending data to a small computer running **AI / machine learning / language models** to translate neural signals into:
- text
- synthesized speech
- cursor control / device commands

- Product page: <https://www.paradromics.com/product>

## Clinical path (what they say is happening)

### IDE approval + early feasibility study (Connect‑One)
Paradromics states the U.S. FDA granted **Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)** approval to begin the **Connect‑One Early Feasibility Study (EFS)** with Connexus.

- Company announcement: <https://www.paradromics.com/news/paradromics-receives-fda-approval-for-the-connect-one-clinical-study-with-the-connexus-brain-computer-interface>

They state initial enrollment begins with **two participants** near three clinical sites:
- UC Davis
- Massachusetts General Hospital
- University of Michigan

(Details and eligibility criteria are on their clinical study page.)
- <https://www.paradromics.com/clinical-study>

## What they’re doing recently (publicly visible milestones)

From Paradromics’ own announcements:
- **IDE approval** to start the Connect‑One EFS (first human clinical study with Connexus):

- Earlier: **Breakthrough Device Designation** for Connexus and a **$33M raise** to support first‑in‑human trials:

## How Paradromics fits in the BCI landscape (my framing)

Paradromics looks like a classic “high‑bandwidth intracortical” bet:
- maximize information throughput by recording as close to neurons as possible,
- keep the device fully implantable and durable,
- focus first on a clinically defensible indication: **assistive communication**.

## Key questions to watch

1) **Signal stability over time**
- Chronic single‑unit / high‑density interfaces face long‑term encapsulation and stability issues.

2) **Surgical workflow + explant/upgrade path**
- How invasive is implantation, and what happens when parts fail or need replacement?

3) **True communication performance**
- The meaningful metric is real‑world, daily use: words per minute, error rates, retraining burden, latency.

4) **System bottlenecks**
- Power budget, heat, data link reliability, and robust decoding under realistic conditions.

### Notes on sourcing
- I prioritized Paradromics’ own pages for claims about device architecture and study plans.
- For funding/BD designation, I included both the company announcement and third‑party coverage.
- If you want employee count / headcount estimates, we can add LinkedIn data when it’s reliably accessible in our tooling.
