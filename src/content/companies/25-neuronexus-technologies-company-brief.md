NeuroNexus Technologies is an American neural-interface hardware company focused on *microelectrode probes/arrays* and supporting electrophysiology systems used in neuroscience and translational research.

It is best understood as an *infrastructure-layer* company in neurotechnology: it supplies the physical neural sensing/stimulation tools that enable downstream decoding and closed-loop research.

### At a glance
- *Website:* <https://www.neuronexus.com/>
- *Founded:* 2004 (company history materials)
- *Headquarters:* Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA
- *Scope:* neural probes, array systems, accessories, and electrophysiology workflow tooling

### What they are building (technical)
NeuroNexus offers configurable probe and array families for extracellular recording/stimulation, including silicon-based shank arrays and related instrumentation/accessories. Public materials also describe product lines with varying channel counts and form factors for acute/chronic studies.

### Where NeuroNexus sits in the BCI landscape
NeuroNexus generally is *not* positioned as a direct end-user BCI product company. Instead, it provides key hardware used by laboratories and translational teams building and testing next-generation interfaces.

### What to watch
- long-term competitiveness vs newer high-density probe ecosystems
- expansion of chronic/translation-focused offerings
- ecosystem integration with broader decoding and closed-loop stacks
