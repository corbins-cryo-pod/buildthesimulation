StairMed is a Shanghai-based medical technology company reported to be running invasive BMI/BCI trials with **ultra-flexible electrodes** connected to a **coin-sized implant** embedded in the skull.

## Reported first-in-man trial (Shanghai / Huashan Hospital)

Shanghai’s English-language government news portal (citing chinadaily.com.cn) reports:
- implant at **Huashan Hospital (Fudan University)** on March 25, 2025
- two ultra-flexible electrodes ("~one-hundredth the thickness of human hair")
- coin-sized implant embedded in the skull, wireless transmission of signals
- after training, the participant could control games (chess, racing)
- article frames this as China’s **first invasive BMI first-in-man clinical trial**

## Why it’s interesting

StairMed is part of a broader Chinese push to build an invasive BCI pipeline (hardware + clinical deployment). The immediate technical questions are:
- signal quality and stability
- safety and migration
- how much “bandwidth” is achievable with very small electrode counts

## What to watch

1) **Peer-reviewed data / registry details**
2) **Indication focus** (assistive control vs rehab vs communication)
3) **Hardware evolution** (channels, packaging, recharge, longevity)

Draft. Current citations are mainly government/media reporting and should be strengthened with primary technical publications and trial registry entries.
