UPenn has multiple groups in neuroengineering; one particularly relevant to *biohybrid interface concepts* is the **Cullen Lab**, which focuses on neural injury mechanisms and neural tissue engineering treatments.

- Cullen Lab overview: <https://www.med.upenn.edu/cullenlab/>

## Why it’s relevant to this site

A lot of future-looking BCI work is constrained by chronic interface biology. Tissue-engineering approaches (including “living electrode” style constructs) are one plausible path toward interfaces that integrate more naturally with nervous tissue.

## TODO (citation upgrades)

- Add 2–4 key publications from the lab that directly relate to:
  - engineered axonal tracts / living electrodes
  - regenerative bioelectronics
  - chronic interface stabilization
