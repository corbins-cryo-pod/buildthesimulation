The *University of Pennsylvania (Penn / UPenn)* is one of the stronger “full-stack” BCI ecosystems in the U.S., with credible depth across:
- *implantable / clinical-facing brain–machine interface (BMI) work* (neurosurgery + neurology + engineering),
- *neural decoding + machine learning* (methods that generalize beyond a single dataset), and
- *interface biology + biohybrid constructs* (the “living electrode” direction).

A useful way to map Penn is: *(1) clinical neuroengineering & implantable systems, (2) decoding/methods, (3) tissue-engineered interfaces.*

### Featured groups (starting set)

### 1) Richardson Lab (Neurosurgery) — clinic-facing brain–machine interfaces
- Lab site: <https://www.med.upenn.edu/richardsonlab/>
- Research page: <https://www.med.upenn.edu/richardsonlab/research.html>

Penn’s neurosurgery-facing BMI work matters because it is forced to care about the practical constraints that dominate translation (implants, materials, workflow, and long-term function).

### 2) Pesaran Lab — brain–machine interfaces and motor-system signals
- Penn Medicine BMI page: <https://www.med.upenn.edu/pesaran-lab/brain-machine-interfaces>
- Lab site: <https://pesaranlab.org/>

### 3) Penn Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics (CNT) + Litt Lab — translational neuroengineering
- Penn Neurology “Translational Centers of Excellence” page (mentions CNT): <https://www.med.upenn.edu/neurology/tce.html>
- Litt Lab: <https://littlab.seas.upenn.edu/>

CNT/Litt is a Penn signature: *device + data + clinical workflow* under one umbrella.

### 4) Kording Lab — decoding and ML methods (BCI-enabling infrastructure)
- Lab: <https://kordinglab.com/>

A lot of usable BCI progress is methods progress: robustness, generalization, calibration reduction, and evaluation.

### 5) Cullen Lab — biohybrid interfaces and “living electrodes”
- Lab: <https://www.med.upenn.edu/cullenlab/>

Penn’s “interface biology” thread is a real differentiator. One representative, directly relevant paper on engineered axonal tracts as “living electrodes”:
- Serruya MD, et al. *Engineered Axonal Tracts as “Living Electrodes” for Synaptic-Based Modulation of Neural Circuitry.* PubMed: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34045935/>

### Clean claims you can make (with sources)
1) Penn has multiple labs explicitly describing *brain–machine interface / BCI* research aims (e.g., Richardson, Pesaran).
2) Penn has an institutional translation push via *CNT*, bridging Perelman School of Medicine and Penn Engineering. <https://www.med.upenn.edu/neurology/tce.html>
3) Penn has a serious *biohybrid / living electrode* thread targeting chronic interface biology constraints. <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34045935/>
