Axogen is a publicly traded U.S. medical device company focused on **peripheral nerve repair and regeneration**. It develops implantable biologic and synthetic products used in surgical repair of damaged peripheral nerves (trauma, reconstruction, elective nerve repair).

Axogen is **not** a brain–computer interface company in the classic “decode neural activity” sense. But it sits adjacent to long-term BCI/peripheral nerve interface efforts because it directly addresses nerve continuity, regeneration, and interface-ready anatomy.

## At a glance
- **Website:** <https://www.axogeninc.com/>
- **Headquarters:** Alachua, Florida, USA (per company/SEC materials)
- **Company type:** Public company (NASDAQ: AXGN)
- **Primary market:** surgical peripheral nerve repair (commercial clinical products)

## What they are building (technical)
Axogen’s portfolio focuses on **structural nerve repair**, not stimulation/recording electronics.

Core product categories (high level):
- processed human nerve allografts (biological scaffolds to bridge nerve gaps)
- nerve connectors and protectors (wraps/conduits to coapt and protect repairs)
- synthetic conduits (typically for shorter gaps; exact indications are product-specific)

In plain terms: Axogen focuses on re-establishing anatomical nerve continuity so axons can regrow toward their targets.

## Where Axogen sits in the BCI / neurotechnology landscape
Axogen is best thought of as a **peripheral nerve “infrastructure” company**: it provides clinically deployed regeneration/repair products that may enable downstream interfaces by preserving or restoring usable nerve pathways.

## What Axogen is not
- not a neural decoding company
- not a stimulation/recording electronics company
- not positioned as a high-bandwidth interface developer

## What’s still unclear / what to watch
- how consistent regenerated organization is for future electrode interfacing (beyond gross functional recovery)
- long-gap and mixed-nerve outcomes relevant to interface readiness
- whether Axogen products get paired with electronic or biohybrid interfaces by partners

## Sources (starting set)
- Axogen corporate site: <https://www.axogeninc.com/>
- (Add) SEC filings (10-K / 10-Q) for specific revenue/employees-by-year numbers (best handled as point-in-time facts)
