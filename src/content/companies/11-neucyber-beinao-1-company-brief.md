NeuCyber NeuroTech is reported as a spinoff linked to the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR, Beijing), with an implant called **Beinao‑1**.

## Reported status (Wired)

Wired reports that:
- Beinao‑1 is a **coin-sized** brain chip
- it has been implanted in **five** people
- recipients with paralysis could move a **cursor** and navigate **smartphone apps** via thought control
- CIBR director Minmin Luo is quoted describing safety/stability assessments

- Wired: <https://www.wired.com/story/china-is-getting-serious-about-brain-computer-interfaces/>

## Why this matters

This is one of the more concrete “state-supported” examples: an institute-linked spinoff implant used in multiple people, in parallel with a national industrial policy push.

## What to watch

1) **Hard technical details**
Electrodes, implantation, channels, telemetry, power.

2) **Independent validation**
Peer-reviewed outcomes or trial registries.

3) **Scaling and support model**
Who manufactures, who implants, how training and home use is supported.

Draft. Current citations are primarily a Wired feature; we should upgrade with primary technical documentation as it becomes available.
