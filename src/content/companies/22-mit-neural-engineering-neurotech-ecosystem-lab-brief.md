MIT’s BCI footprint is best understood as an **enabling-technology powerhouse**: rather than being dominated by one flagship clinical intracortical BCI program, MIT produces a dense set of labs pushing core layers BCIs depend on — **interfaces (materials/devices), sensing + stimulation/modulation modalities, and decoding/analysis infrastructure** — plus training programs explicitly aimed at neurotechnology.

## Ecosystem hub / training

### Center for Neurobiological Engineering (CNBE)
- About: <https://web.mit.edu/cnbe/about.html>
- Training: <https://web.mit.edu/cnbe/training.html>
- Sharing/dissemination: <https://web.mit.edu/cnbe/sharing.html>

CNBE is a clean justification for “MIT as a BCI school” even when individual labs aren’t branded as “BCI labs”: it is explicitly built to accelerate neurotechnology creation, adoption, and training.
