A team at **Technical University of Munich (TUM) University Hospital** reported an invasive BCI implantation in a patient with quadriplegia.

## Reported details

NeuroNews International reports:
- first procedure of this kind performed in Europe (per their framing)
- a custom BCI implanted in a surgery lasting >5 hours
- **256 microelectrodes** capturing signals from an area involved in planning/executing grasp movements
- goal: smartphone control and eventually robotic arm control
- ongoing twice-weekly sessions to train AI decoders

- NeuroNews International: <https://neuronewsinternational.com/researchers-complete-europes-first-bci-implantation-in-quadriplegia-patient/>

## Why it’s interesting

This is a concrete example of Europe pushing back into invasive BCI with a tight integration of:
- neurosurgery
- decoding / AI
- robotics

## What to watch

1) **Published data** (signal characteristics, control metrics)
2) **How they define “success”** (cursor control vs functional robotic manipulation)
3) **Scaling and repeatability** (more participants, longer follow-up)
