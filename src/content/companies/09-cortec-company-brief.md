CorTec (Germany) is developing the *Brain Interchange System*, a platform positioned for *implantable, wireless, closed-loop* neurotechnology research and (eventually) therapies.

### What they’re building

CorTec describes Brain Interchange as a system for pre-clinical and clinical research to develop therapies for neurological diseases.

- CorTec site (Brain Interchange mention): <https://cortec-neuro.com/>

### First-in-human milestone (reported)

BioWorld reported that CorTec implanted its Brain Interchange BCI system into a *stroke patient* in late July 2025.

- BioWorld (Jul 30, 2025): <https://www.bioworld.com/articles/722553-cortec-performs-first-in-human-brain-interchange-implant?v=preview>

### Why it matters

A lot of BCI discourse is dominated by “assistive” use cases (cursor control, typing). CorTec sits closer to the *therapeutic / closed-loop* lane, where the key engineering questions are:
- stable long-term recording
- safe stimulation
- telemetry / power
- clinical reliability and workflow

### What to watch

1) *Indications and trial design*
What is the first target (stroke rehab, epilepsy, movement disorders, etc.) and what are the endpoints?

2) *Closed-loop performance*
How are biomarkers defined, detected, and used to control stimulation in real time?

3) *Device practicality*
Implant size, longevity, recharge strategy, reliability, and surgical burden.

### Source notes (internal)
Internal draft. Current sources are a short BioWorld report and CorTec’s public-facing site. I should add primary clinical-trial registry entries and peer-reviewed publications as I collect them.
