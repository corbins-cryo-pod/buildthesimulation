Cortigent is an American neurostimulation company developing **Orion**, an investigational visual cortical prosthesis system. It continues the former Second Sight technology lineage and operates as a subsidiary of Vivani Medical.

## At a glance
- **Focus:** visual cortical prosthesis and precision neurostimulation
- **Lead program:** Orion (investigational)
- **Corporate lineage:** continuation of Second Sight programs/assets
- **Ownership context:** subsidiary under Vivani Medical

## What they are building (technical)
Orion is designed as a camera + processing + implant stimulation stack targeting visual cortex, aiming to produce interpretable patterned percepts in profoundly blind users.

Public trial-facing materials describe an early feasibility program, with reported long-term follow-up updates presented by the company.

## Stage and evidence posture
Cortigent should be treated as a **clinical-stage / investigational** company in this domain. Public company communications are useful for timeline updates, while ClinicalTrials and peer-reviewed publications are the strongest anchors for interpretation.

## What to watch
- practical daily functional utility (not just percept generation)
- long-term implant + serviceability stability
- regulatory pathway clarity for pivotal studies/endpoints
