Stanford is one of the clearest examples of a **full-stack intracortical BCI ecosystem**: deep basic science + decoder engineering + **human clinical translation** through an organized translational program, plus adjacent implantable neurotechnology work that reinforces real-world “translation muscle.”

A useful way to map Stanford is: **(1) clinic-facing intracortical BCIs, (2) decoder foundations, (3) closed-loop implant neurotech adjacent to BCI.**

## Featured groups (starting set)

### 1) Neural Prosthetics Translational Laboratory (NPTL) — human intracortical BCIs
- NPTL: <https://nptl.stanford.edu/>
- Stanford Neuroscience overview page: <https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/research/funded-research/neural-prosthetics-translational-laboratory>
- Stanford Functional Neurosurgery research page: <https://med.stanford.edu/neurosurgery/divisions/functional/research.html>

NPTL repeatedly produces complete end-to-end systems (signals → decoding → interaction) validated in people with paralysis.

### 2) Neural Prosthetic Systems Lab (Shenoy) — decoder foundations feeding translation
- Shenoy faculty page: <https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/people/krishna-shenoy>

## Adjacent closed-loop implant neurotechnology (BCI-adjacent)

### Brain Interfacing Laboratory (Bronte-Stewart) — sensing neurostimulators and adaptive DBS
- Lab page: <https://med.stanford.edu/bronte-stewart-lab.html>
- Stanford profile: <https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/helen-bronte-stewart>

Even when the end goal is not “cursor control,” the core pattern is the same: implant → sense → decode state → act in a closed loop.
