The University of Michigan is a major center for engineering and biomedical research, including work relevant to neural interfaces and neuroengineering.

Right now this is a **placeholder hub page** because several UMich sites are behind anti-bot protections that make automated citation harvesting flaky. We’ll still list it so we remember to expand it.

## What we’ll expand this into

- A set of specific UMich labs (PI + lab pages)
- A short “why this lab matters” section per lab
- A curated list of peer‑reviewed papers (DOI/PubMed) for core contributions

## TODO (citation upgrades)

- Add primary institutional pages once we can fetch them reliably.
- Add 3–6 representative publications.
