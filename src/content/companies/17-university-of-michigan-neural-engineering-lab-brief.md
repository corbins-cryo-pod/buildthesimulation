The *University of Michigan (UMich)* is best understood less as a single “flagship BCI lab” and more as an *ecosystem* spanning the full stack: *interfaces → circuits → decoding → clinical translation*. It is also historically central to microfabricated silicon probes (the “*Michigan probe*” lineage), which shaped modern high-channel-count neural recording.

### Why UMich matters

- *Clinic-facing iBCI momentum:* UMich has publicly described a dedicated clinical pathway (BCI clinic) and neurosurgery-led implantable BCI work.
- *Hardware lineage:* UMich engineering describes the Michigan probe as a turning point in multi-site neural recording.
- *Breadth:* intracortical systems work coexists with noninvasive clinical BCI efforts focused on practical usability.

### Featured labs and what they contribute

### 1) Willsey Laboratory for Brain–Computer Interfaces (implantable iBCI, neurosurgery)

*Professor:* Matthew Willsey, MD, PhD (Neurosurgery)

### 4) Michigan neural probe lineage (microfabricated silicon probes)

UMich engineering highlights the “Michigan probe” as a major inflection point in multi-site neural recording:

### Recommended structure going forward

If this hub stays useful as the atlas grows, the next step is to fork into subpages (one per lab) with:
- PI + official pages
- interface types (intracortical / EEG / probes)
- 3–6 key publications (PubMed/DOI)
- links back to relevant Devices entries
