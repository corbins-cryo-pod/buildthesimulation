The *University of Utah* is one of the most historically important institutions in neural engineering — especially for *implantable microelectrode interfaces* — and it remains a modern center for *neuroprosthetics, closed-loop systems, and clinical translation*.

Utah’s ecosystem is best understood as a tight coupling of:
1) a neural interface hardware lineage (Utah Electrode Array),
2) an institutional center focused on neural interfaces, and
3) active labs pushing neuroprosthetics, rehab, and clinic-adjacent neurotechnology.

### Why Utah belongs in the directory

- *Foundational neural interface hardware:* the Utah Electrode Array (UEA) originated here and remains a key platform in implantable BCI research.
- *Institutional center for interfaces:* Utah’s Center for Neural Interfaces (CNI) explicitly focuses on restoring sensory feedback and motor control using implantable arrays.
- *Human translation:* Utah has visible human work in cortical visual prosthesis research using intracortical stimulation.
- *Strategic priority:* Utah BME has publicly advertised neural engineering / neural interfaces hiring.

### Featured labs and what they contribute

### 1) Center for Neural Interfaces (CNI)
- *Official site:* <https://cni.bme.utah.edu/>

CNI is a strong ecosystem anchor at Utah: not a single PI’s page, but a long-running center built around implantable interfaces and neuroprosthetic function.

- Moran news (2021): <https://healthcare.utah.edu/moran/news/2021/10/scientists-enable-blind-woman-see-simple-shapes-using-brain-implant>

*Representative clinical paper:*
- Fernández E, et al. *Visual percepts evoked with an intracortical 96-channel microelectrode array inserted in human occipital cortex.* J Clin Invest. 2021. doi: 10.1172/JCI151331. PubMed: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34665780/>

### 4) Utah NeuroRobotics Lab
- *Lab site:* <https://neurorobotics.ece.utah.edu/>

This lab helps keep the hub from being “Utah = electrodes only,” by showing the systems layer: shared control, rehab robotics, and neural engineering in assistive tech.
