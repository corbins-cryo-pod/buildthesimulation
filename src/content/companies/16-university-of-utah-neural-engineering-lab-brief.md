The University of Utah is one of the historically important institutions in neural engineering and neurotechnology, with ongoing work spanning **neural interfaces**, **biomaterials**, **implantable devices**, and translation through clinical partners.

This entry is intentionally a **hub**: we can later break it into specific labs (e.g., electrode development, visual prostheses, biohybrid interfaces) as we build out the directory.

## Evidence of active neurotech hiring/priority

Utah BME explicitly advertises neurotechnology/BCI faculty hiring and lists neural engineering as a major research area.

- Utah Biomedical Engineering (research areas + neurotechnology faculty search):
  <https://www.bme.utah.edu/>

## Why it belongs in the directory

- Strong cross-disciplinary environment (engineering + medicine).
- Longstanding contributions to neural interface hardware.

## TODO (citation upgrades)

When we do a deep pass, we should add:
- specific Utah labs (PI + lab page) for:
  - microelectrode arrays / fabrication
  - stimulation and neuroprosthetics
  - retinal / cortical prosthesis work
- 2–4 flagship peer‑reviewed publications per thread.
