Axoft is pursuing a materials-first approach to invasive BCIs: make the implant *extremely soft* (closer to brain tissue mechanics) so the interface causes less chronic irritation, scarring, and drift.

The core claim is straightforward:
- conventional implant materials are mechanically mismatched with brain tissue
- micromotion + foreign-body response degrade long-term signal quality
- a brain-like polymer could improve *long-term stability*

### What they’re building (public description)

Axoft describes a full stack:
- a *bioinspired soft implant* (ultra-soft material)
- integrated electronics + wireless data path
- surgical tools to place very soft probes without using the probe itself as the rigid inserter
- decoding software

- Axoft homepage: <https://axoft.us/>

### Human/clinical status (public reporting)

Axoft announced approval for a *first-in-human clinical study* planned for early 2025 at *The Panama Clinic*. Public reporting describes the study as testing insertion + recording feasibility during already-planned resection surgeries.

- Medical Device Network summary (Dec 20, 2024): <https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/axoft-go-ahead-for-brain-implant-trial/>

### Why this is interesting

If Axoft’s mechanical matching actually translates into:
- lower glial scarring / neuron loss near the interface
- lower drift
- stable single-unit recordings over long timescales

…then it’s a direct shot at one of the hardest real problems in invasive BCI: *maintaining usable signals for years*.

### What to watch

1) *Signal stability vs time* (weeks → months → years)
2) *Surgical workflow* for very soft probes (tooling, reliability, placement repeatability)
3) *Failure modes* (buckling, delamination, encapsulation, connector issues)
4) *Actual clinical indication path* (what’s the first medical use case, and how does it win vs existing implants?)
