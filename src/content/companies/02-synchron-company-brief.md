Synchron is developing a brain–computer interface (BCI) that is *implanted through the blood vessels* (endovascular) rather than via open-craniotomy placement of cortical arrays. Their core device concept is the *Stentrode*: a stent-mounted electrode array deployed into a cerebral venous sinus, paired with an implanted telemetry unit that transmits signals wirelessly.

This brief leans hard on *peer‑reviewed clinical data* and other primary sources.

### At a glance

- *Website:* <https://synchron.com/>
- *Procedure (company description):* Synchron describes a *minimally-invasive endovascular procedure* “similar to the placement of stents” that avoids open brain surgery. (Synchron homepage)
  - <https://synchron.com/>
- *Contact / location (company site footer):* the site lists *Brooklyn, NY* along with contact emails. (Synchron contact/footer page)

> Private-company note: public sources rarely give reliable revenue/profit data for private neurotech startups. If I can’t support a number with a solid source, we don’t claim it.

### The technology (what makes Synchron different)

### 1) Stentrode = stent‑electrode array in a blood vessel
A Stentrode is a *stent-mounted electrode array* permanently implanted into a blood vessel near cortex, enabling recording without penetrating brain tissue.

- Overview page (Wikipedia; includes citations to primary papers + trials):
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent-electrode_recording_array>

### 2) Implant location + signal path
Public descriptions and clinical papers describe:
- deployment via the *jugular vein* into a cerebral blood vessel adjacent to motor cortex,
- electrodes apposed to the vessel wall,
- signals routed to an implanted unit and sent wirelessly to an external receiver.

(Background overview and citations: Stentrode page)
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stent-electrode_recording_array>

### 3) Why endovascular placement matters
Compared with intracortical arrays:
- *Surgery burden may be lower* (no craniotomy; uses interventional neurovascular techniques).
- *Neural signal characteristics differ* (electrodes are separated from cortex by vessel wall + CSF; recordings are typically closer to ECoG-like signals than penetrating microelectrode spikes).
- *Vascular device risks are real* (thrombosis/stenosis risk; need antiplatelet therapy considerations; imaging follow-up).

### Human evidence (peer‑reviewed)

### Safety in severe paralysis (JAMA Neurology, 2023)
A key human dataset is the *SWITCH study* (“Stentrode With Thought‑Controlled Digital Switch”). The publication reports safety outcomes in *4 patients* with severe paralysis using a fully implanted endovascular BCI.

- Mitchell et al., *JAMA Neurology* (2023): “Assessment of Safety of a Fully Implanted Endovascular Brain‑Computer Interface for Severe Paralysis in 4 Patients: The Stentrode With Thought‑Controlled Digital Switch (SWITCH) Study.”

  - PMC full text: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9857731/>

### Earlier first‑in‑human experience (Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery, 2020)
An earlier report describes first‑in‑human experience in severe paralysis and discusses activities-of-daily-living type outcomes.

- Oxley & Yoo, *Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery* (2020): “Motor neuroprosthesis implanted with neurointerventional surgery improves capacity for activities of daily living tasks in severe paralysis: first in human experience.”
  - (DOI omitted; see PMC full text)
  - PMC: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7848062/>

### Preclinical foundation (Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2018)
The Stentrode concept was also demonstrated preclinically as a chronic endovascular interface.

- Opie et al., *Nature Biomedical Engineering* (2018): “Focal stimulation of the sheep motor cortex with a chronically implanted minimally invasive electrode array mounted on an endovascular stent.”
  - DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-018-0321-z>

### Trials (public registry)

ClinicalTrials.gov has entries relevant to early feasibility testing of the Stentrode device.

- “Stentrode with Thought-controlled Digital Switch…” (listed on the Stentrode overview page as NCT03834857)
  - <https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03834857>

### Company activity / “what they’re doing recently”

Synchron positions its BCI as an at‑home system aimed at autonomy and social connection.

- Company framing (Synchron homepage): <https://synchron.com/>

If needed *recent milestones* (e.g., participant counts, regulatory designations, notable demos), I should base them on:
- peer‑reviewed publications,
- trial registry updates,
- regulator announcements,
- or major outlets (Reuters, etc.).

### What to watch next (technical + translational)

1) *Signal quality and bandwidth vs invasiveness*
- Endovascular placement trades surgical invasiveness for potentially lower signal amplitude / spatial specificity compared with penetrating arrays.

2) *Long-term vascular safety*
- Chronic implant in cerebral venous sinuses raises questions about thrombosis risk, antiplatelet regimens, and long-term patency.

3) *Decoder stability in real life*
- The real benchmark is not “can you move a cursor once?” but *stable daily use* (months/years) with minimal retraining.

4) *Expanding control modalities*
- Today: cursor/OS control + discrete selections.
- Next: richer multi-DOF control, speech interfaces, or combined stimulation/recording applications.

### Source notes (internal)
- For *technology + human data*, I prioritized peer‑reviewed papers (JAMA Neurology; JNIS) and trial registry.
- Wikipedia is used only as a navigation hub to primary sources (and should be treated as secondary).
