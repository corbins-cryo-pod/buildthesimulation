Precision Neuroscience is pursuing a distinct engineering point in the BCI design space: *high-channel-count cortical surface sensing* with a *thin, conformal film* that can be *placed on the brain surface* rather than penetrating into cortex.

Their core device is the *Layer 7 Cortical Interface* — a high-density electrode array embedded in a flexible film intended for recording/monitoring (and, per their regulatory clearance/press coverage, stimulation) of cortical activity.

### At a glance

- *Website:* <https://precisionneuro.io/>
- *About page (company narrative + leadership):* <https://precisionneuro.io/about>
- *Headquarters:* New York City (per press coverage; confirm on LinkedIn later if we want a consistent data source).

### The technology: Layer 7 Cortical Interface

Public descriptions emphasize:
- *Cortical surface* interface (non-penetrating)
- *Thin-film* flexible array designed to conform to the brain surface
- *High electrode count*: commonly reported as *1,024 electrodes*

Secondary reporting (MassDevice) describes the Layer 7 device as:
- *1,024 electrodes* embedded in a flexible film
- thinness on the order of *~one-fifth the thickness of a human hair* (journalistic paraphrase of company claims)

- MassDevice (Apr 17, 2025): <https://www.massdevice.com/precision-neuroscience-fda-clearance-bci-interface/>

Precision’s own framing is explicit about the design goal:
> “a high-bandwidth connection to the brain that did not rely on penetrating electrodes”

### Regulatory status (key differentiator)

Precision reports that it received an FDA *510(k) clearance* in 2025 for the Layer 7 Cortical Interface.

- Precision “About” (mentions first FDA clearance in 2025): <https://precisionneuro.io/about>

Multiple outlets report this as FDA *510(k) clearance* and note a commercially-cleared use case window up to *30 days* implantation.

### Why this approach is interesting (and what to watch)

### 1) Minimally invasive doesn’t mean “easy,” but it changes the risk profile
A surface array avoids penetrating tissue and may reduce certain risks (e.g., insertion trauma), but it still lives in a surgical environment with constraints around stability, infection, and long-term biocompatibility.

### 2) Surface recordings: bandwidth vs spatial specificity
High-density surface electrodes can offer rich signals, but the spatial selectivity differs from intracortical spikes. This makes algorithm+hardware co-design central: what do you decode, from which signal features, under what motion/noise conditions?

### 3) Clinical workflow matters
One of the more practical near-term wedges is *intraoperative mapping* (explicitly mentioned in reporting). That path pressures the system to be useful quickly, with neurosurgical-friendly setup time, robust connectors, and clean data plumbing.

- MassDevice notes intraoperative mapping as a clinical marketing path post-clearance: <https://www.massdevice.com/precision-neuroscience-fda-clearance-bci-interface/>

### 4) “Removable” and “up to 30 days” are big claims — watch the details
A surface interface that is both high-density and safely removable (and has a cleared temporary implant window) is a meaningful engineering milestone. The details that will matter:
- what the cleared indications actually are
- what “up to 30 days” means in practice (patient selection, monitoring, adverse event profile)
- signal quality drift over days/weeks

### Company notes (from Precision)

Precision’s own history highlights:
- founded/started work in *2021*
- leadership includes co-founder *Ben Rapoport (MD, PhD)*
- claims of owning/operating manufacturing capacity via acquiring a microfabrication facility (Precision BioMEMS)
- FDA Breakthrough Designation (2023) and FDA 510(k) Clearance (2025)

- For the core “what is it” and “why this design,” I rely on Precision’s own About page.
- For regulatory status and numerical claims (electrode count, 30-day clearance window), I cite secondary coverage plus the primary FDA 510(k) PDF.
