INBRAIN Neuroelectronics is a neurotechnology company pushing a very specific materials-driven bet: *graphene electrodes*, fabricated with semiconductor-style processes, as a path to *higher-resolution sensing and safer, more stable stimulation* than traditional metal electrodes.

Unlike many BCI companies whose public narrative is dominated by cursor control or typing demos, INBRAIN frames its core product as *BCI-Tx (therapeutic BCI)*: decoding biomarkers and then modulating circuits with *micrometer-scale* targeting.

### At a glance

- *Website:* <https://inbrain-neuroelectronics.com/>
- *Core platform claim (company):* “skin-like, bi-directional, high resolution (up to *1024 contacts*)” cortical interfaces + implantable processor + AI platform; FDA *Breakthrough Device Designation* for Parkinson’s use (per company).

### The technology thesis: why graphene?

Graphene is attractive here because it is *conductive carbon* rather than a metal, and INBRAIN argues this changes the long-run electrochemistry of stimulation/recording interfaces.

IEEE Spectrum’s coverage summarizes INBRAIN’s argument:
- metallic electrodes can undergo *Faradaic reactions* in aqueous tissue environments, degrading effectiveness over time
- graphene can support high charge injection while avoiding the same failure mode, potentially improving stability over many stimulation pulses

- IEEE Spectrum (Jul 23, 2024): “New Brain-Computer Interface Uses Graphene”
  - <https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-computer-interface-graphene>

INBRAIN’s own platform description emphasizes:
- *high charge injection capacity* + *low electrical impedance* → reduced power requirements → miniaturization
- flexible, “skin-like” high-resolution interfaces

### Interface design: high-density cortical film + precision surgery wedge

A key near-term wedge for high-density cortical interfaces is *intraoperative mapping* / precision neurosurgery.

INBRAIN reports a first-in-human use as part of tumor resection workflow:
- the cortical interface is used to *monitor brain activity* and help distinguish *cancerous vs healthy tissue* during resection
- performed at *Salford Royal Hospital* (Manchester)
- described as part of a clinical study sponsored by the *University of Manchester*
- the initial human study is described as *8–10 patients*, aimed primarily at demonstrating graphene safety in direct brain contact

### Therapeutic direction: Parkinson’s and closed-loop precision neuromodulation

INBRAIN’s public messaging places its platform in the *closed-loop neuromodulation* lane:
- decode biomarkers in real time
- modulate cortical/subcortical structures with high precision

- Company site: <https://inbrain-neuroelectronics.com/>

IEEE Spectrum notes INBRAIN received FDA *Breakthrough Device Designation* for its system as an adjunctive therapy in Parkinson’s disease, and discusses a strategy of decoding intention + pathological biomarkers (tremor/rigidity/freezing), with the longer-term goal of targeted therapy.

- IEEE Spectrum: <https://spectrum.ieee.org/brain-computer-interface-graphene>

### What to watch

1) *Chronic stability and safety*
The intraoperative/tumor-resection context is a pragmatic first step, but the real test is chronic implantation: stability of impedance, encapsulation, and stimulation safety over long durations.

2) *“High resolution” → clinical value*
High-density recordings can be impressive; the question is whether they translate into better outcomes (better resection margins, fewer deficits, or better control/therapy in movement disorders).

3) *Regulatory clarity*
They mention Breakthrough Device Designation for Parkinson’s. The most defensible version is to cite an FDA listing or a primary press release once I can fetch it reliably (some presswire endpoints are flaky).
