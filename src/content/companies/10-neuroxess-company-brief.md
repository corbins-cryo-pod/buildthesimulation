NeuroXess is a Shanghai-based BCI company mentioned in reporting about China’s push to build an implantable BCI industry.

### Reported status (Wired)

Wired reports that:
- NeuroXess’ CEO Phoenix Peng says the company has *implanted six* paralyzed patients
- in three patients, the system was used to *decode Chinese speech*
- in others, it enabled *thought control of digital devices*

- Wired: “China Is Building a Brain-Computer Interface Industry” (policy + company quotes):
  <https://www.wired.com/story/china-is-getting-serious-about-brain-computer-interfaces/>

### Why it’s worth tracking

China’s BCI ecosystem is increasingly driven by:
- centralized policy roadmaps (2027/2030 milestones)
- rapid trial starts
- building a local supply chain (chips, electrodes, decoding algorithms)

NeuroXess is one of the clearest named examples in mainstream reporting with multi-patient implant claims.

### What to watch

1) *Peer-reviewed publications / technical details*
Electrode type, channel count, implantation approach, and decoding pipeline.

2) *Regulatory pathway*
What approvals exist now, and what is the path to a marketed medical device?

3) *Performance metrics*
Accuracy, throughput, training time, stability over months.
