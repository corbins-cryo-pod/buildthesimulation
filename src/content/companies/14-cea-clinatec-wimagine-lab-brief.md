CEA‑Clinatec (Grenoble, France) is widely cited for an eye-catching demonstration: a person with tetraplegia controlling a heavy exoskeleton via implanted brain interfaces.

### Reported demonstration (media coverage)

A summary writeup (with links out to more coverage) describes:
- electrode grids implanted over sensorimotor cortex
- decoding algorithm translating signals into exoskeleton commands
- extensive training using an avatar in a virtual environment
- the exoskeleton required a harness and remained a lab prototype

- Northern California Spinal Cord Network summary (Oct 2019):
  <https://norcalsci.org/news/2019/10/6/brain-implants-help-quadriplegic-walk-with-min-controlled-exoskeleton-suit>

(That page links to BBC coverage.)

### Why it matters

Even if the system is not a near-term product, it demonstrates:
- feasibility of high-level whole-body assistive control
- the importance of decoder training + interface design
- the practical realities (weight, balance, safety harness) that separate demos from products

### What to watch

1) *Peer-reviewed publications* describing the implanted system and decoding pipeline
2) *Transition from lab prototype → usable assistive device*
3) *Long-term signal stability* with implanted ECoG

### Notes on sourcing
Draft. This entry is currently anchored in a secondary summary article; we should replace/add primary publications and institutional pages for WIMAGINE/Clinatec.
