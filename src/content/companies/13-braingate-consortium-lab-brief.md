BrainGate is one of the most important long-running invasive BCI clinical research efforts. Public-facing descriptions emphasize restoring *communication, mobility, and independence* for people with paralysis.

### A landmark result: brain-to-text via attempted handwriting (Nature, 2021)

A widely cited BrainGate-linked demonstration decoded attempted handwriting trajectories from intracortical recordings to produce text at high speed.

- Willett et al., *Nature* (2021): “High-performance brain-to-text communication via handwriting.”
  - Article: <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03506-2>

A readable overview with some performance numbers:

### Why BrainGate matters

If needed to understand what intracortical arrays can do at the “high performance” end, BrainGate is one of the strongest evidence bases.

It’s also a good example of a translational pipeline:
- carefully run clinical research
- repeated improvements in decoding methods
- longer-term attention to usability and at-home use

### What to watch

1) *Generalization + daily use*
How performance holds up across days without re-training.

2) *Scaling channels and stability*
What hardware stack they use and how signal quality evolves.

3) *Clinical commercialization path*
How/when these systems become actual products.
