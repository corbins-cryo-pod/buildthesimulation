This week was mostly about **turning Build The Simulation into a maintainable reference site**: a directory of companies/labs (BCI Atlas), a growing catalog of neural interface designs (Devices), and a simulation sandbox that’s actually usable by other people.

## Progress

### Devices catalog (designs)
- Expanded the Devices catalog with template-consistent entries (stable IDs, spec-card grid layout, and references).
- Started treating some entries as **design families** when appropriate (e.g., spiral/helical nerve cuff electrodes), and adding separate entries for notable implementations.

### BCI Atlas
- Improved map reliability by making sure there is **always** a working fallback (SVG world map with pins) so the page never renders blank.
- Moved from a single test pin to **auto-generated pins** for all entries with `lat/lon`, and fixed pin alignment by accounting for image scaling/letterboxing.

### Site foundations
- Continued moving toward a “magazine + textbook + simulation” structure backed by Astro content collections so writing and updating stays frictionless.

## Direction: a catalog you can actually browse

The goal isn’t just to accumulate pages — it’s to make a **searchable browser** where someone can quickly find:
- device classes (intracortical vs ECoG vs PNI vs endovascular)
- intended use (recording vs stimulation)
- clinical status (human vs research)
- modality-specific properties (wireless, fully implanted, channel count ranges, etc.)

### What “search + tags” should look like
On the Devices index page, we should support:
- a simple **text search** (title + short description + tags)
- **clickable tags** to refine results (multi-select)
- obvious “active filters” pills + one-click clear
- URL-driven state (optional but ideal): share a filtered view like `/devices?tag=intracortical&tag=wireless`

Implementation plan (practical, static-site friendly):
- Use frontmatter fields + `tags` as the canonical metadata.
- Render all device cards server-side, but add a tiny client-side script to filter/hide cards instantly.
- Keep it robust on Cloudflare Pages (no external dependencies required).

We can do the same for the **BCI Atlas index** (companies/labs): tags like “company”, “lab”, “intracortical”, “ECoG”, “endovascular”, “China”, etc., plus region/location filters later.

## Simulation documentation: where it should live

Right now the simulation exists, but discovery + onboarding are the weak points. The docs should live in a place that is:
- easy to find from the nav
- one click away from the simulation UI
- written for people who don’t already know what the controls mean

### Proposed structure
- Keep the simulator at **`/sim`** (short, memorable).
- Add a “How to use this simulation” guide at **`/simulations/nerve-cross-section/guide/`**.
- Make `/simulations/nerve-cross-section/` a small landing page that links to:
  - **Run the simulation** → `/sim`
  - **Guide / documentation** → `/simulations/nerve-cross-section/guide/`

### What the guide should include (minimum viable)
- 30-second orientation: what the sim is and isn’t (proxy model)
- core interactions: pan/zoom, add/move electrodes, read the plots
- “what to try” recipes (e.g., change falloff, move electrodes, watch thresholded recruitment)
- a short glossary (axon sites, falloff, threshold, recruitment)
- a link back to the Devices catalog so the sim feels connected to the catalog

## Plan for next week

- Implement the first version of **search + tag filtering** on `/devices`.
- Add a **simulation guide page** and link to it prominently from both `/simulations/nerve-cross-section/` and `/sim`.
- Keep adding Devices entries, but start tightening references toward PubMed/DOI whenever possible.
