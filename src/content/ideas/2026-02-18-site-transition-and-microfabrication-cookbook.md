This month I want to shift buildthesimulation.com into a more workable, production-ready website.

### 1) Rebuild the article library by hand

I want to completely redo the article set myself so the core topics are covered in a way that is technically clear and useful:
- neuroscience fundamentals
- implantation methods and constraints
- microfabrication and packaging realities

I may fully remove the current article set and replace it with hand-written versions.

### 2) Start a microfabrication cookbook

I want to build a structured *microfabrication cookbook* — a series of documents that map practical manufacturing pathways for neural probes and electrodes, grounded in existing research and theory.

Goal: move from broad descriptions to step-by-step fabrication logic that can actually guide design decisions.

### 3) Expand the device atlas far beyond company products

I want the devices list to grow from mostly company products into a research-grounded atlas that includes publication-derived devices and historical designs.

Immediate additions I want:
- more literature-based entries
- device images on entries/cards
- 3D models of each device that can feed simulation workflows

### 4) Upgrade article depth and visual evidence

Future articles should explicitly define the problem in detail and include stronger technical visuals, including:
- electron microscopy images
- neuroimaging figures where relevant
- other evidence-quality visuals that clarify geometry, tissue interaction, and failure modes

I want to write most of this directly myself.

### 5) Long-term simulation direction

Long term, I want the simulations to evolve toward scientifically sound neuron and interface models for testing and building neural probes.

Even longer term, I want a full design-and-test loop for neural implants:
- design implant geometry
- run model-based testing
- compare outcomes and iterate

That is the direction: from reference site → technical design platform.
