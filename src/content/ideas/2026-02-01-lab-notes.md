This is the first **Lab notes** post. The goal of this section is to track *our work* (not field-wide news).

## Progress

- Built the peripheral nerve cross-section sandbox (v0): electrode placement, pulse visualization, zoom/pan, export/import.

## Observations

- The most useful features so far are the ones that make geometry tangible: contacts, scale, and thresholded activation.

## Open questions

- What should the first “real” selectivity metric be for nerve cross-sections?
- How should we represent axon orientation / recruitment beyond a scalar field proxy?

## Plan for next week

- Add cuff contact configuration (choose active contacts, rotation, multipolar patterns).
- Add fascicle layout presets.
- Add a simple selectivity metric panel.
