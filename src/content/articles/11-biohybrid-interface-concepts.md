A biohybrid interface is an attempt to use biology as an asset rather than a nuisance. Instead of placing an inert device next to tissue and hoping the body tolerates it, biohybrid strategies try to make the interface *participate* in the biological environment.

This is an exciting direction, but it’s also where hype can get out of hand. The goal of this chapter is to define the space clearly and keep the exploration open: biohybrid may be *a* path, not *the* path.

## What “biohybrid” can mean

Biohybrid is not one technology. It can mean:

- **living coatings or cell-laden scaffolds** that modulate tissue response,
- **engineered tissues** that interface with axons and provide structured geometry,
- **conductive biological composites** (hydrogels, ECM-like scaffolds with conductive elements),
- **regenerative interfaces** where axons grow through a designed structure.

These ideas differ drastically in feasibility and validation burden.

## Why biohybrid is attractive

Biohybrid approaches are attractive because they target the chronic constraints directly:

- stabilize the geometry through guided growth,
- reduce mechanical mismatch,
- modulate inflammation and encapsulation,
- and potentially enable higher selectivity.

The dream is a stable, structured interface that behaves more like tissue than like a foreign object.

## The hard part: metrics and time

Biohybrid approaches are slow to validate because biology is slow. A design that looks great at 2 weeks may fail at 6 months.

If you want to stay grounded, define success metrics early:

- stable thresholds over time,
- stable selectivity proxies,
- functional outcomes,
- absence of pain and adverse remodeling,
- manufacturable repeatability.

## Keeping the exploration open

It’s worth explicitly exploring non-biohybrid approaches in parallel:

- improved extraneural field shaping and better mechanics,
- less invasive intrafascicular designs with robust strain relief,
- hybrid systems that combine a stable cuff with targeted stimulation strategies.

Biohybrid doesn’t need to win by being “cool.” It needs to win by being stable, safe, and manufacturable.
