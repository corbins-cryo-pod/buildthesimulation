Regeneration is where the peripheral nerve story becomes fundamentally different from cortex. The peripheral nervous system has nontrivial regenerative capacity, and that opens a design space: instead of placing an electrode near existing tissue, you can attempt to shape the tissue itself.

This chapter frames regeneration in a way that is useful for engineering regenerative and biohybrid interfaces.

### What counts as “regeneration”

Regeneration is not a single thing. Depending on context, success might mean:

- axons regrow across a gap,
- conduction returns,
- functional motor/sensory outcomes improve,
- pain does not increase,
- the new tissue architecture supports a stable interface.

For a regenerative neural interface, the last point is often the hard one: can you create a geometry that stays useful?

### Guidance: geometry is biology

Guidance channels, conduits, and scaffolds are attempts to impose geometry on regrowing axons.

From an interface perspective, guidance is attractive because it may allow:

- predictable spatial organization,
- improved selectivity,
- and potentially improved chronic stability.

But it also adds validation complexity: you now have a time-dependent biological system, and your device performance is coupled to healing.

### Engineering constraints

Regenerative strategies are constrained by:

- vascularization and nutrient transport,
- immune response and fibrosis,
- mechanical robustness under motion,
- manufacturability and sterilization.
