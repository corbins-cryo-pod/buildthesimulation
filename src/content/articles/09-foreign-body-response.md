The foreign body response (FBR) is not a side effect; it is the environment in which chronic implants live. Once an interface is implanted, the body begins a cascade of protein adsorption, immune activation, and tissue remodeling.

For neural interfaces, the consequence is that the “electrical interface” is time-dependent. Encapsulation changes distance, impedance, and mechanical coupling.

## The qualitative timeline

While details vary by tissue and device, a useful high-level model is:

- immediate protein adsorption onto surfaces,
- acute inflammation,
- macrophage-driven remodeling and fibroblast activity,
- formation of a fibrotic capsule or reactive tissue layer.

In brain, glial responses are central. In peripheral nerve, fibrosis and mechanical compression risk can be central.

## Why it matters for signals

Encapsulation often behaves like a chronic filter:

- it increases effective distance to sources,
- it can increase impedance and noise,
- it changes stimulation thresholds,
- and it can increase micromotion by altering mechanical coupling.

## Design levers

You do not fully control biology, but you can change the regime:

- surface chemistry and roughness,
- mechanical compliance and motion,
- minimizing injury during implantation,
- stable packaging to avoid corrosion products.
