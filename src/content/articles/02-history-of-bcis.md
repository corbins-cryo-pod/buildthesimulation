> **Reader promise:** You’ll be able to place modern BCI claims in context, identify what’s genuinely new vs repackaged, and predict the bottlenecks.

## TL;DR

- BCIs progressed through **better sensors**, **better task definitions**, and **better algorithms**—but chronic stability and usability remain the wall.
- The same bottlenecks repeat: **SNR**, **nonstationarity**, **tissue response**, **power/bandwidth**, and **human-in-the-loop** realities.
- Peripheral nerve and biohybrid approaches change the trade space: different geometry, different failure modes, different opportunities.

## Definitions

- **BCI:** A system that converts neural activity into control signals (and often closes the loop with stimulation/feedback).
- **Nonstationarity:** The mapping from neural signals to behavior changes over time.

## Outline

### 1) Prehistory → early invasive work
- Single-unit recordings and early decoding
- Why “it works in the lab” didn’t translate

### 2) ECoG, EEG, and the usability trade-off
- Lower bandwidth but safer/easier
- Paradigms that succeeded (and why)

### 3) Modern era: high-channel-count + ML
- What improved: scale, tooling, models
- What didn’t: chronic reliability, surgery burden

### 4) The recurring bottlenecks (a checklist)
- Signal quality and artifacts
- Stability across weeks/months
- Packaging, power, wireless, heat
- Calibration and user training

### 5) Where peripheral nerve + biohybrid fits
- What problems it might solve
- New problems it introduces
