Neuralink is one of the highest-profile brain–computer interface (BCI) companies. It is building an **implantable, wireless intracortical recording system** and a **surgical robot** intended to place fine electrode “threads” into cortex. The company’s stated early medical focus is helping people with severe paralysis control digital devices.

This is a **company brief**: what can be supported by public sources, what is uncertain, and what to watch.

## At a glance

- **Website:** <https://neuralink.com/>
- **Headquarters (public listings):** Fremont, California (USA). (LinkedIn lists Fremont, CA as HQ; MapQuest lists a Fremont location.)
  - MapQuest listing: <https://www.mapquest.com/us/california/neuralink-corp-458353238>
- **Company type:** privately held (per LinkedIn). (Private companies typically do not publish audited revenue.)
  - LinkedIn company page: <https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuralink/>
- **Employees (best-effort public signal):** LinkedIn lists **company size 201–500** and also shows a “discover all **625 employees**” link at time of access. Treat this as an *approximate* social-network count, not an audited headcount.

## What they are building (technical description)

Neuralink’s public descriptions point to a system with three major pieces:

1) **Implant (intracortical recording hardware)**
- A brain implant intended to record neural activity (and transmit data wirelessly to external devices).

2) **Surgical robot**
- A robotic system designed to insert electrode threads with high precision.

3) **Decoding/software layer**
- Software that maps recorded neural signals to control of a cursor and other device actions.

In plain terms: **record spikes in motor-related cortex → decode intent → move a cursor**.

## What they’ve done recently (publicly reported)

### First human implant (reported)
News reporting in early 2024 describes the first human implant and the beginning of human testing.

- Fox Business report (Jan 2024) describes Musk stating the first human received an implant and that early results showed “neuron spike detection.”

### Trials + participant counts (reported)
Reuters reporting in mid‑2025 states Neuralink had begun clinical trials across multiple countries and that patients were using the system to control devices.

- Reuters (June 2025): reports Neuralink raised $650M and states **five patients with severe paralysis** were using Neuralink to control digital and physical devices with their thoughts; it also mentions FDA “breakthrough” device tags for speech and vision restoration devices.

### Production / automation goals (reported)
- Reuters (Dec 2025 / Jan 2026): reports Musk stated Neuralink would start “high‑volume production” of BCI devices and move to an “entirely automated surgical procedure” in 2026.

## Money: revenue vs funding (what we can and can’t say)

### Revenue
Neuralink is privately held; **revenue is not publicly disclosed** in a reliable, audited way. If you see revenue figures online, they are usually estimates.

### Funding (reported)
- Reuters (June 2025): Neuralink said it raised **$650 million** in a funding round (with named participating investors).

## Where Neuralink sits in the BCI landscape (my framing)

Neuralink is best thought of as:
- **high-channel-count intracortical recording** (aspirationally “high bandwidth”),
- paired with a **hardware + surgical-automation strategy**,
- pushing toward **consumer-like usability** (wireless, at-home use) but inside a very hard medical/regulatory environment.

## What’s still unclear / key questions to watch

1) **Long-term reliability**
- Signal stability over months/years; electrode encapsulation; durability of threads; explant/replacement strategy.

2) **Surgical throughput + risk**
- Whether automation actually reduces time, cost, and complication rates at scale.

3) **True information throughput**
- “Channel count” is not the same as usable degrees-of-freedom. The key is stable decoding performance over time.

4) **Clinical indication pathway**
- Near-term: paralysis/cursor control is a plausible first product path.
- Longer-term claims (speech, vision, broader neurological conditions) need careful evidence.

### Notes on sourcing
I’m intentionally favoring primary/major reporting sources (e.g., Reuters) and official pages over scraped “startup list” aggregators. For private-company stats (employees, location), public directories and LinkedIn are imperfect but often the best available signals.
