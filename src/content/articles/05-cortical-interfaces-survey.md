> **Reader promise:** You’ll understand what each cortical modality buys you, why chronic performance degrades, and what “next-gen” claims must prove.

## TL;DR

- Cortex gives rich signals, but implantation + tissue response impose real costs.
- High channel count is not the same thing as stable, usable information.
- Packaging, power, and surgical workflow often dominate.

## Definitions

- **ECoG:** Electrocorticography (surface recordings).
- **Penetrating array:** Microelectrodes inserted into cortex.
- **SEEG:** Stereoelectroencephalography (depth electrodes).

## Outline

### 1) Modalities and their sweet spots

### 2) Chronic failure modes
- Micromotion, gliosis, encapsulation

### 3) What “better” should mean
- Stability metrics, calibration burden, user experience

### 4) Lessons to port to peripheral nerve and biohybrid work

## References

- Add canonical reviews + key chronic studies.
