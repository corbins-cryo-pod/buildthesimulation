> **Reader promise:** You’ll be able to map interface types to goals (selectivity, longevity, invasiveness) and spot hand-wavy claims.

## TL;DR

- You pick an interface by trading off **selectivity vs invasiveness vs chronic stability**.
- Geometry matters: fascicles, perineurium/epineurium, and motion change everything.
- Regenerative and biohybrid concepts are promising but require clear success metrics.

## Definitions

- **Cuff electrode:** Surrounds the nerve; generally less invasive, lower selectivity.
- **Intrafascicular:** Penetrates toward/into fascicles; higher selectivity, higher risk.
- **Regenerative interface:** Designed to integrate with regrowing axons through a scaffold.

## Outline

### 1) Anatomy that matters (for engineers)
- Fascicles, connective tissue, vascular constraints

### 2) Cuff family
- What it does well / poorly
- Failure modes

### 3) FINE and reshaping approaches
- Why reshaping helps selectivity

### 4) Intrafascicular approaches
- Selectivity vs damage trade

### 5) Regenerative / conduit-based interfaces
- What counts as “success”
- Chronic integration challenges

### 6) Decision table
- If your goal is X, start with Y
